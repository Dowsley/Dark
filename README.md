They say the war lasted one week. Truth is, all we know from this time, is that no one ever won. Humanity as a whole was torn apart, with decentralized pockets of survivors left with a bleeding, war-torn home, filled with weapons from the past and the remnants of the invading forces, spread out through the planet. left crippled, and forced to survive within the planet.

Still, there are some who believe the war is still going. Some believe there's deeper secret.

There, a hero will rise.
